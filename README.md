-> in pyFiles
### hello.py
- initial commit to start the repo up, prints "hello, world!"
### addTypes.py
- trying to add variables together and finding solutions for ValueErrors
### lorenz.py
- 3D matplotlib visualization of the Lorenz attractor (the "butterfly" of chaos theory)
- Euler integration of the Lorenz ODEs with chunked Line3DCollection rendering for performance
- dark theme, time-based inferno colormap with colorbar, and scroll-wheel zoom
- "Learn More" button opens the companion HTML page in your default browser
### lorenz_info.html
- static educational page covering the background story, differential equations, parameter meanings, and real-world applications of the Lorenz attractor
- rendered with a dark theme and LaTeX equations via MathJax

## Why?
I will be preparing for the course by doing some objectives to test my ability.

I learn use cases for basic git to push my code publically.
Some basic commands I have controlled now:
```
git status
git add .
git commit -m "[message here]"
git push
```
