# Python-Primer assesments


## What does this repo entail?
-> in pyfiles
### hello.py
- initial commit to start the repo up, prints "hello, world!"
### addTypes.py
- trying to add variables together and finding solutions for ValueErrors
###  lorenz.py
- displaying a lorenz attractor in 3d using python libraries and some math
- added a more interactive view so you zoom in and out
- added color gradiens by its position in time

## Why?
I will be preparing for the course by doing some objectives to test my ability.

I learn use cases for basic git to push my code publically.
Some basic commands I have controlled now:
```
git status
git add .
git commit -m "[message here]"
git push
```
