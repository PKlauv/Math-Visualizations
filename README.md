# Python-Primer assesments


## What does this repo entail?
### hello.py
- initial commit to start the repo up, prints "hello, world!"
### refreshers -> addTypes.py
- trying to add variables together and finding solutions for ValueErrors

## Why?
I will be preparing for the course by doing some objectives to test my ability.

I learn use cases for basic git to push my code publically.
Some basic commands I have controlled now:
```
git status
git add .
git commit -m "[message here]"
git push
```
