An interactive collection of mathematical objects — chaos theory, topology, and fractals — rendered in the browser.

## Visualizations

- **[Lorenz Attractor](https://pklauv.github.io/lorenz-attractor/visualizations/lorenz.html)** — The butterfly of chaos theory. Animated 3D trajectory with cinematic camera, differential equations, and the story behind Lorenz's 1963 discovery.

- **[Mobius Strip](https://pklauv.github.io/lorenz-attractor/visualizations/mobius.html)** — A surface with one side and one edge. Interactive 3D surface with adjustable half-twists and width, parametric equations, and connections to the Klein bottle.

- **[Klein Bottle](https://pklauv.github.io/lorenz-attractor/visualizations/klein.html)** — A closed surface with no inside or outside. Figure-8 immersion in 3D with adjustable opacity and scale, auto-rotation, and topology explanations.

- **[Sierpinski Triangle](https://pklauv.github.io/lorenz-attractor/visualizations/sierpinski.html)** — Infinite self-similarity from a simple rule. Recursive subdivision and chaos game methods, animated depth build-up, and fractal dimension.

- **[Mandelbrot Set](https://pklauv.github.io/lorenz-attractor/visualizations/mandelbrot.html)** — Infinite complexity from z squared plus c. Click-to-zoom explorer with adjustable iterations, multiple color schemes, and smooth coloring.
